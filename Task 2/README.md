# CarbonMarketsHQ_Assignment 2


The workflow of this task is as follows:

1- Creating synthetic dataset \
2- Creating a custom price calculator\
3- Visualization of different factors and how they affect the pricing\
4- Command line implementation of Custom pricing model (User Input)

## Limitations 

1. **Simplified Assumptions**: The model uses simplified assumptions about how each factor influences the price.
2. **Limited Factors Used**: Other potential factors like project verification, market demand, and regulatory changes are not included.
3. **No Real-World Data**: The model is based on synthetic data. Using real-world data could improve accuracy and relevance.


**Improvements**:
- Incorporate more factors and real-world data.
- Use machine learning models to capture complex interactions between factors.
- Continuously update the model with new data and trends.
